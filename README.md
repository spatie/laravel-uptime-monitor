Laravel-uptime-monitor is a powerful, easy to configure uptime monitor. It will notify you when your site is down (and when it comes back up). You can also be notified a few days before an SSL certificate on one of your sites expires. Under the hood, the package leverages Laravel native notifications, so it's easy to use Slack, Telegram or your preferred notification provider.

You'll find extensive documentation on [https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-uptime-monitor]. It includes detailed info on how to install and use the package.

If you're not familiar with Laravel, but still want to use our uptime monitor, take a look at the [uptime-monitor-app](https://github.com/spatie/uptime-monitor-app) repo which contains a stand alone version of this package.

Reading the config file of this package is a good way to quickly get a feel of what `laravel-uptime-monitor` can do. Here's the content of the config file:

```php
return [

    /*
     * You can get notified when specific events occur. Out of the box you can use 'mail'
     * and 'slack'. Of course you can also specify your own notification classes.
     */
    'notifications' => [

        'notifications' => [
            \Spatie\UptimeMonitor\Notifications\Notifications\UptimeCheckFailed::class => ['slack'],

        ],

        'location' => '',

        /*
